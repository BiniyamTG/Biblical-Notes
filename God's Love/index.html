        <p class="author">By Biniyam Teketel</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve experienced the unbroken, purest form of intimacy with GOD. በእግዚአብሔር ህልውና ተከበው ነበር ፣ ልባቸው ውስጥ የእግዚአብሔር ምሉዕ ሀሳብ ነበር His perfect Will. The Garden, in its original design, was not just a home but a place of perfect fellowship, a place where every breath taken was a whisper of God's love.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">Yet, love always carries with it the invitation to choose. Love, by its very nature, cannot be forced or manipulated; it is a gift given to be freely received. And so, God gave Adam and Eve this gift —the gift of choice. The command was simple: "You may eat freely from every tree in the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat" (Genesis 2:16-17). God’s instruction was not an arbitrary rule, but an act of divine love. It was a boundary, not to restrict them, but to protect them. In obeying God's command, they would remain in harmony with the One who created them, shielded from the devastating effects of sin and death.</p>

        <p class="content-text">But love, in its most tragic form, is also the choice to disobey. The serpent, twisted the beauty of God's gift and seduced Eve into tasting the forbidden fruit. She, in turn, gave it to Adam, and in that single moment, their hearts shattered. The light of their innocence was extinguished. The veil of sin was drawn, and with it came shame, fear, and death. “Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths” (Genesis 3:7). They knew, in that instant, both the beauty and the burden of knowledge—knowledge that was never meant to be theirs, knowledge that separated them from the source of their life.</p>

            “Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked...” – Genesis 3:7
        </blockquote>

    
        
        <p class="content-text">At the heart of the Garden stood two significant trees: the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. These trees were not merely symbolic; they represented two different paths of life, freedom, and relationship.</p>
        
        <p class="content-text">The Tree of Life symbolized God’s divine presence and the eternal life He offers. Eating from this tree represented dependence on God as the source of true life. Proverbs 3:18 connects wisdom with the Tree of Life: "She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her; those who hold her fast will be blessed." From the beginning, God intended humanity to partake in His wisdom and life, living in a state of eternal communion with Him.</p>

        <blockquote class="verse">
            “እርስዋ ለሚይዙአት የሕይወት ዛፍ ናት፥ የተመረኰዘባትም ሁሉ ምስጉን ነው።” – Proverbs 3:18
        </blockquote>

        <p class="content-text">The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, on the other hand, represented humanity's choice: to trust God’s definition of good and evil or to seize autonomy by defining it for themselves. Genesis 2:16-17 records God’s command: "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die." Eating from this tree was an act of rebellion, choosing self-reliance over trust in God, resulting in separation, suffering, and death (Romans 6:23). It was the first step away from the true source of life, and it led to the fall of mankind.</p>

        
        
        <p class="content-text">After the fall, God exiles Adam and Eve, barring access to the Tree of Life. Genesis 3:22-24 reveals God’s rationale:</p>

        <blockquote class="verse">
            “The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.” – Genesis 3:22-24
        </blockquote>

        <p class="content-text">የእግዚአብሔር ፍቅር የተገለጠው ሰውን ወደ ኤደን ገነት በማስገባቱ ብቻ ሳይሆን ከኤደን ገነት በማስወጣቱም ነበር።In their fallen state, eternal life would mean eternal corruption. By guarding the Tree of Life, God preserves the hope of redemption and restoration. He withholds eternal life from them to protect የሰው ልጅ ለዘለዓለም ከእግዚአብሔር ተለይቶ እንዳይኖር።</p>

        
        
        <p class="content-text">The theme of the Tree of Life resurfaces throughout Scripture, pointing to God’s grand plan of salvation. Proverbs 11:30 says, "The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life," highlighting the transformative power of God’s wisdom and righteousness. Similarly, Ezekiel’s vision of the restored temple includes trees bearing fruit for healing:</p>

        <blockquote class="verse">
            “Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river... Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing” – Ezekiel 47:12
        </blockquote>

        <p class="content-text">Ultimately, Jesus Himself becomes the fulfillment of the Tree of Life. In John 15:5, He declares, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit.” Jesus offers the eternal life that the Tree of Life symbolized, fulfilling the promise made to Adam and Eve.</p>

    
        
        <p class="content-text">In an ironic twist, the tree of death —the cross becomes the Tree of Life for humanity. Galatians 3:13 explains, "በእንጨት የሚሰቀል ሁሉ የተረገመ ነው ተብሎ ተጽፎአልና ክርስቶስ ስለ እኛ እርግማን ሆኖ ከሕግ እርግማን ዋጀን፤" Through His death and resurrection, Jesus opens the way back to the Tree of Life, fulfilling the hope of redemption and defeating sin and death.</p>

        <p class="content-text">The cross, which represents the most devastating and painful moment in history, becomes the gateway to eternal life. By dying on the cross, Jesus takes upon Himself the consequences of humanity's rebellion, allowing for the restoration of the relationship that was lost in Eden. Through His sacrifice, He reverses the curse of death that began in the Garden, making a way for humanity to return to the Tree of Life.</p>

        

        <p class="content-text">The Bible ends with a return to the garden-temple in Revelation. Revelation 22:1-2 describes the restored Tree of Life:</p>

        <blockquote class="verse">
            “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life... On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.” – Revelation 22:1-2
        </blockquote>

        <p class="content-text">In this new creation, the Tree of Life is accessible to all who trust in Jesus, symbolizing the restoration of God’s perfect plan. What was lost in Eden is restored in the New Jerusalem, where believers will have unbroken communion with God, eternally nourished by the Tree of Life.</p>

        

        <p class="content-text">The expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden was not a rejection but an act of mercy. God, in His profound love, knew that without the promise of redemption, eternal life in their fallen state would be eternal suffering. Through the expulsion, He preserved the hope for restoration, pointing forward to the day when He would send His Son to bring the Tree of Life back into reach. The love of God is most fully displayed not in the entry to Eden, but in the way He made a way for humanity to return to Him, even through the pain of exile.</p>

        <p class="content-text">Friends, God’s love is revealed not only when we are in a place of paradise but also when He mercifully removes us from it to protect us, to redeem us, and to prepare us for a far greater, eternal paradise in His presence.</p>
